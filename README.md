##### A. Configure Branch Protection Rules

###### 1. Go to Repository Settings:

- Navigate to **Settings > Rules > Rulesets > New branch ruleset**.

###### 2. Create a New Ruleset:

- **Enforcement Status**: Set to Enabled.
- **Add Target**: Include the default branch (e.g., main).

###### 3. Set the Following Rules:

- **Require a Pull Request Before Merging**:
  - Enable **Dismiss stale pull request approvals when new commits are pushed**.
- **Require Status Checks to Pass Before Merging**:
  - Enable **Require branches to be up to date before merging**.
  Under **Add checks**, include the following:
    - preview (from your GitHub Actions workflow).

##### B. Configure GitHub Actions Settings

###### 1. Go to Actions Settings:

- Navigate to **Settings > Actions > General**.

###### 2. Set Workflow Permissions:

- Choose **Read and write permissions**.

###### 3. Allow Pull Request Creating by Github Actions:

- Enable **Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests**.

#### 5. Configure Your VPS

Before deploying, ensure your VPS is set up correctly by following these steps:

##### 1. Install Docker

Make sure Docker is installed and running on your VPS. If not, refer to the official Docker installation guide: [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

##### 2. Copy Files

Copy the contents of the `.vps` folder to your VPS.

##### 3. Configure the .env file

Edit the `.env` file with the appropriate variables:

```env
# Generate using `htpasswd -nB user`  
# When generated, duplicate `$` signs
PREVIEW_AUTH_CREDENTIALS=  

# Use the required environment variables based on your DNS provider.  
# The example below is for Name.com. Refer to the Traefik documentation for the appropriate variables for your provider:  
# https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/https/acme/#providers  
NAMECOM_USERNAME=  
NAMECOM_API_TOKEN=  

# Certificate email (use your own)  
CERT_EMAIL=

# Docker Hub registry (for example: user/myapp)  
REGISTRY_NAME=  

PREVIEW_IMAGE=latest  
PRODUCTION_IMAGE=latest 
```

##### 4. Update docker-compose.yml

Edit the `docker-compose.yml` file where indicated:

- Replace the domain **krustberry.xyz** with your own domain.
- Update the DNS provider (**namedotcom**) with the provider you‚Äôre using, as per the Traefik documentation.
